<p class="p4">Interest in IT</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>I have been interested in IT for many years. Growing up in the 1990s, I witnessed life as we know it undergo a huge positive transformation - due to the rapid technological advances taking place all around us.</li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Out of my many magical moments of computer related discoveries, the most significant would have to be the advent of music-making software in the early 2000s. As a budding young creative, had it not been for the slow and bulky family PC gathering dust in the corner of our lounge room, I would never even have had the chance to enter the field of music production, which has (just) paid my bills for the past ten years.</li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>In 2021, I chose to come to RMIT and take some online classes on the topics of IT and programming. The “why” for me is very clear - knowing how to utilise the processing power of a computer to solve real world problems is a highly valuable skill. What took a little more consideration was the “when”, juggling work and family responsibilities. Fortunately, the global pandemic helped make that decision for me.</li>

<p class="p3">Lead Audio Software Engineer - Output, Inc. CA USA</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Description of position: Lead Audio Software Engineer is a role that entails several aspects of technology and arts to develop music-making software for the professional market. I am particularly interested in this role because I have been using exactly these kinds of software for the last few years for thousands of hours.</li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Description of skills required: Degree in Computer Science, 5 years of experience in developing audio applications, experience working in a team.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Current skills: my current skills comfortably cover the relevant areas of songwriting and music production, and could go as far as product testing.</li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Plan to obtain skills: complete RMIT degree, start making an effort to learn about this particular industry and what I can do to get started until I get my qualification, utilise my connections in the music business to build relationships with people who could help in the employment process.</li>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>My personality type is ENFT-P, also known as Campaigner. Being a campaigner means I’m outgoing and introspective at the same time, thoughtful yet impulsive. Creative and abstract problems drive me and bring out the best in me, while discipline and adherence to a fixed path can present challenges. I tend to get consumed with new ideas and opportunities. Often others look to me for perspective, for inspiration, for encouragement, and I take on this role gratefully. I generally believe in the ability of other people and try to encourage those around me to perform at a high level. In my current work as a music producer, having this personality type is what enables me to effectively communicate creative ideas to people with varying levels of background knowledge. This personality type lends itself to certain roles within a team more than others. I feel comfortable driving ideas, concepts, planning, communication. However, I find it difficult to be accountable for organisational aspects of projects, such as following a timeline, working towards deadlines, paying attention to the more tedious details of execution. Being aware of this natural inclination, I can make more educated decisions when it comes to taking on a role within a team. I can see myself making valuable contributions to the design, concept and testing stages of projects. My areas of weakness would be in organisation and debugging.</li>

  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Online learning style test</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>My learning style: Auditory 55%, Visual 20%, Tactile 25%</li>
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>My learning style as an Auditory learner comes with certain particular advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, as implied by the name, I tend to understand things better when I hear them out loud or present them to myself in an auditory way rather than visual or tactile. This might be my minds way of breaking large chunks of information into smaller bite-sized pieces. Normally I can read and process information quite quickly when looking for something in particular or trying to gain an overall understanding of the material. However, I lose track of details and often miss important parts by going too fast. That’s why I manage to focus more deeply and subsequently retain important information if I hear it rather than read it. This has some implications for my usefulness in a team. Developing a solid line of communication plays a crucial role because as an Auditory learner I rely on hearing others’ interpretation of a problem to gain a better understanding of it. The best way to take this into account when forming a team would be to try and identify team members who I can communicate with easily, to take advantage of my style of learning.</li>

<p class="p4">Project Idea</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Overview (100 words)</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>This project aims to create an audio plugin software to assist in digital music production, songwriting, and composition. The software will generate possible suitable chord progressions and / or melodies to be used in any music project, based on inputs from the user such as song key, song tempo, desired emotion, degree of complexity. The plugin will output the chosen information as MIDI files. Users will also be able to preview the output of the plugin as audio before exporting. The MIDI files which will be generated by this plugin can be used to trigger sounds from any synthesiser, regardless of whether software or hardware.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Motivation (100 words)</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>The music industry generates close to 2 billion dollars in revenue annually for songwriters, composers and producers alone. Due to the rapid increase in processing power of personal computers in the early 2000s, the majority of music makers shifted their working process from bulky, expensive and unreliable hardware to cheap, accurate and reliable software. As someone who has personally been making music on computers professionally for the past 10+ years , I’m acutely aware of amount of human labour which is needlessly repeated on tasks which could easily be automated. I intend to use my experience as a writer, in conjunction with my gradually improving skills as a programmer, to help others increase their efficiency, productivity, and possibly even creativity.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Description (500 words)</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>This software’s primary function is to enable users with little to no musical knowledge to effortlessly build detailed and emotive musical compositions with the click of a few buttons and the turning of a few knobs.</li>
  </ul>

  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Skills required (100 words)</li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>Outcome (100 words)</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span>This plugin will enable users with zero musical knowledge to write compelling compositions in a matter of seconds and seamlessly incorporate them into any active music project they’re working on. It will achieve this by drawing on a bank of pre programmed music theory data, as well as simple algorithms designed to use the power of sorting and randomising functions to quickly generate musical phrases.</li>
